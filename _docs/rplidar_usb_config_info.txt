sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyUSB0

rosrun rplidar_ros rplidarNodeClient

===How to remap the USB serial port name===

    Maybe you should change the usb device port mode with the authority of read and write, more than make the port remap to an fixed name. 
    install USB port remap: ./catkin_ws/src/rplidar_ros/scripts/create_udev_rules.sh

    chack the remap using following command: ls -l /dev | grep ttyUSB usb_port_remap

    Once you have change the USB port remap, you can change the launch file about the serial_port value.
    <param name="serial_port" type="string" value="/dev/rplidar"/>
